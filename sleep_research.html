									<h1>Advances in Deep Learning for Automatic Sleep Stage Classification: A Comprehensive Survey</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Sleep stage classification is a critical component of sleep medicine and neuroscience research. Traditionally performed using polysomnography (PSG) and manual annotation, automatic sleep staging has emerged as a promising field leveraging machine learning and, more recently, deep learning methods. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), attention-based mechanisms, and transformer architectures have significantly advanced performance across various datasets. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This survey reviews recent progress in automatic sleep staging with a focus on model architectures, feature extraction techniques, multimodal integration, and dataset usage. We systematically analyze representative models such as <b>SleePyCo, DeepSleepNet-Lite, SleepEGAN, L-SeqSleepNet, XSleepNet, CTCNet</b>, and others, highlighting their contributions, advantages, and limitations. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative overview of dataset popularity (e.g., Sleep-EDF, SHHS, MASS, ISRUC) and methodological trends. Finally, we discuss open challenges, including class imbalance, generalizability, real-time implementation, and future directions.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Sleep staging is crucial in healthcare, but manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. With the rise of deep learning, automatic sleep staging has advanced significantly. This survey provides a structured overview of recent models, datasets, preprocessing strategies, and future challenges in this domain.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Background</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Sleep Architecture and Staging Rules</h3>
  <p>
    Sleep is divided into Wake, N1, N2, N3, and REM stages based on AASM guidelines. These stages reflect brain activity and physiological signals during rest.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Data Sources</h3>
  <p>
    Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard, recording EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, and respiration. Wearables also provide PPG and limited EEG, expanding accessibility.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Datasets</h2>
  <p>
    Widely used datasets include <b>Sleep-EDF</b>, <b>SHHS</b>, <b>MASS</b>, <b>ISRUC</b>, <b>MGH</b>, and <b>MESA</b>. Sleep-EDF and SHHS dominate research, while ISRUC and MASS include pathological cases. Dataset diversity influences model generalization.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Deep Learning Models</h2>
  <h3>4.1 CNN-based Models</h3>
  <p>
    CNNs are dominant for local feature extraction. Examples: DeepSleepNet-Lite, CNN-attention hybrids. They are efficient but struggle with long-term dependencies.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 RNN-based Models</h3>
  <p>
    RNNs (e.g., BiLSTM, GRU) model sequential dependencies. Example: L-SeqSleepNet. They capture temporal context but are computationally heavy.
  </p>

  <h3>4.3 Transformers and Attention</h3>
  <p>
    Transformers are increasingly used, e.g., SleePyCo, CTCNet, SleepTransformer. They provide interpretability and model intra/inter-epoch dependencies but require high memory.
  </p>

  <h3>4.4 Hybrid Models</h3>
  <p>
    Combining CNN + Transformer (e.g., CTCNet) or GAN-based approaches (e.g., SleepEGAN) improves performance. Graph-based and multimodal methods (EEG+EOG+EMG) are emerging.
  </p>

  <h3>4.5 Lightweight and Real-Time Models</h3>
  <p>
    DeepSleepNet-Lite and microcontroller-based models enable wearable deployment. These prioritize efficiency and low resource use.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Preprocessing & Features</h2>
  <p>
    Strategies range from raw EEG input to preprocessing with FFT, CWT, STFT, and ICA. Recent work explores self-supervised pretraining to reduce reliance on heavy feature engineering.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Quantitative Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    Metrics include accuracy, F1-score, and Cohenâ€™s Kappa. CNNs achieve high accuracy but limited generalization. Transformers balance performance and interpretability. GANs and SSL improve minority-stage detection.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Open Challenges & Future Directions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Class imbalance (especially N1 detection)</li>
    <li>Generalization to pathological populations</li>
    <li>Lightweight models for real-time wearables</li>
    <li>Improved interpretability for clinical use</li>
    <li>Self-supervised and federated learning</li>
    <li>Cross-modal signal integration</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Deep learning has transformed automatic sleep staging, with CNNs and transformers leading progress. Despite significant advances, challenges remain in generalization, class imbalance, and real-time deployment. Future research will focus on lightweight, interpretable, multimodal, and self-supervised models for broader clinical adoption.
